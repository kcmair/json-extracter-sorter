# Overview

I chose the Java programming language for this project because I have very limited experience with it but have always wanted to learn it.

This program is designed to read a JSON format file containing multiple pieces of data in each object and extract the specific pieces of data that I need, namely the date and sample code.

# Development Environment

To learn Java, I used W3Schools and BeginnersBook and learned about the history of the language on Wikipedia.

Some of the libraries I used to create this project include:
- Java.io to read and write files to disk.
- Jackson Databind to read and write JSON to a map.
- Java.util for error handling.

# Future Work

- Add the ability to select a file from Finder/File Explorer.
- Add the ability to specify the path for the new file using Finder/File Explorer.
- Add the ability to read the data directly from the database instead of saving it to a JSON file first.
